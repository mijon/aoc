# Advent of Code

I have a few part-finished repos for AoC in a few different languages.
However, I'm trying to learn Haskell and APL using AoC and I want to collect all the stars so I'm starting right from the beginning and work through each year.

I'll also fold in my 2020 and 2021 attempts when I get to them and any future AoCs will be in this repo.
